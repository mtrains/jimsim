JIM SIM

Simulator of a guy named Jim. The possibilities are endless. 

This project will create a fun game for multiple people to enjoy, develop my own programming abilities, and explore what is possible. 

Phase 0: Planning  
    Complete this ReadMe
    Determine the best programming language(s) to use for the project
    Baseline research for what tools are required to complete the project
Phase 1: 3D World
    Create a basic 3D environment that can be navigated
    Create a simple character, Jim, that the user can control
Phase 2: Create 1-5 buildings that Jim can interact with as part of the game
    Home
        Jim can claim a home as his own. Max one home. He then gains ownership of the home, can lock the doors, use the car, etc. 
    Store
        Jim can choose and buy groceries and other items here
    Office building
        Jim can work here to get cash that can be spent at stores
Phase 3: Cloud Computing 
    Can be implemented at any point in the design process
    Allow for multiplayer games where different people can join and play on the same world at the same time
    Players can interact with anyone close to them on the map
Phase 4: World Expansion 
    End goal is to have the map the size of planet earth
    Determine a coordinate system in order for the earth to be round, so sections of the map are generated accurately, without overcomplicated processes slowing the game down
    Import data from world maps
        Start with roads. For example, if google maps has a road going from point A to B, the game will generate that road when the player gets close to those coordinates on the map. 
        Then buildings. When map data shows there is, for example, a grocery store at a certain location, a new store object will be generated at those coordinates using the classes created in Phase 2. 
Phase 5: More Structures, Play Features, and Accuracy 
    Create more types of buildings that are common in our world that will enhance the player experience 
        Department stores, gyms, apartments, schools, other businesses, warehouses, etc. 
    Increase play features such as eating, driving, gambling, more jobs, travel
        The game could be many simulators at once, such as a flight simulator starting at an airport, or a train simulator at a train yard
    Multiplayer interactivity 
        Text chats that can be read by players near each other or anywhere on the map if they have a phone
        Could have a voice option where only players near each other can hear the audio coming from your mic (softer if you're further away)
        Could even have speakers that play music from a player's spotify account or device
    Improved world generation based on imported map data
        Differing road sizes, building placement, changes in elevation, bodies of water, other nature elements
Phase 6: AI world enhancement (ambitious route)
    A much more ambitious phase. In theory, AI can be trained and used to generate realistic and accurate structures based on street view and satelite images. 
    This is sure to come with many unexpected challenges, so I will need to reevaluate the feasibility of this idea once the other phases are complete. 
    In order to create a realistic world, developers typically must either design each structure manually or generate a world with repetitive structures. However if an AI was trained to create 3D models based on multiple reference images (which street view could provide), we could have accurate structures created in massive quantities. AI created 3D models based on reference images is also a very useful technology for many other things, and it's likely this technology is already being developed.
