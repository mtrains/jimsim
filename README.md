JIM SIM

Simulator of a guy named Jim. The possibilities are endless. 

This project will create a fun game for multiple people to enjoy, develop my own programming abilities, and explore what is possible. 

Phase 0: Planning  
    - Complete this ReadMe
    - Determine the best programming language(s) to use for the project
    - Baseline research for what tools are required to complete the project
    
Phase 1: 3D World
    - Create a basic 3D environment that can be navigated
    - Create a simple character, Jim, that the user can control
    
Phase 2: Create 1-5 buildings that Jim can interact with as part of the game
    - Home
        - Jim can claim a home as his own. Max one home. He then gains ownership of the home, can lock the doors, use the car, etc. 
    - Store
        - Jim can choose and buy groceries and other items here
    - Office building
        - Jim can work here to get cash that can be spent at stores
        
Phase 3: Cloud Computing 
    - Can be implemented at any point in the design process
    - Allow for multiplayer games where different people can join and play on the same world at the same time
    - Players can interact with anyone close to them on the map
    
Phase 4: World Expansion 
    - End goal is to have the map the size of planet earth
    - Determine a coordinate system in order for the earth to be round, so sections of the map are generated accurately, without overcomplicated processes slowing the game down
    - Import data from world maps
        - Start with roads. For example, if google maps has a road going from point A to B, the game will generate that road when the player gets close to those coordinates on the map. 
        - Then buildings. When map data shows there is, for example, a grocery store at a certain location, a new store object will be generated at those coordinates using the classes created in Phase 2. 
        
Phase 5: More Structures, Play Features, and Accuracy 
    - Create more types of buildings that are common in our world that will enhance the player experience 
        - Department stores, gyms, apartments, schools, other businesses, warehouses, etc. 
    - Increase play features such as eating, driving, gambling, more jobs, travel
        - The game could be many simulators at once, such as a flight simulator starting at an airport, or a train simulator at a train yard
    - Multiplayer interactivity 
        - Text chats that can be read by players near each other or anywhere on the map if they have a phone
        - Could have a voice option where only players near each other can hear the audio coming from your mic (softer if you're further away)
        - Could even have speakers that play music from a player's spotify account or device
    - Improved world generation based on imported map data
        - Differing road sizes, building placement, changes in elevation, bodies of water, other nature elements
        
Phase 6: AI world enhancement (ambitious route)
    - A much more ambitious phase. In theory, AI can be trained and used to generate realistic and accurate structures based on street view and satelite images. 
    - This is sure to come with many unexpected challenges, so I will need to reevaluate the feasibility of this idea once the other phases are complete. 
    - In order to create a realistic world, developers typically must either design each structure manually or generate a world with repetitive structures. However if an AI was trained to create 3D models based on multiple reference images (which street view could provide), we could have accurate structures created in massive quantities. AI created 3D models based on reference images is also a very useful technology for many other things, and it's likely this technology is already being developed.
